Clean Architecture:
  - domain layer (business logic)
  - application layer (service logic)
  - interfaces layer (ports of access)
  - infrastructure layer (adapters to persistent storage or other services)

Domain Driven Design
  - encapsulate business logic
  - in its own "universal language"
  - within the domain layer

Command Query Responsability Separation
  - implement the application layer
  - based on separation of
  - write (command) models and
  - read (query) models

Domain Aggregates
  - access the domain's data structures
  - through a single top level aggregate`,
